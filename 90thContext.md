# 90COS Engagement Overview

## Relationship Details
We have a subcontract through Global Infotech (GITI) for about 3 people to support for about 6 months. For more context on 
the 90th in general, check out [the 90th baseball card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wQa-0pU80tmOOLHHrgVxoN0rbE6LUVSVK31ySRGBdEA/edit?usp=sharing).
Scott is our primary POC for GITI. 

## Discovery Sprint
During the week of 22 August, we did a set of discovery interviews with members from Various teams from the 90th. 
We synthesized the interviews and ID'd a plan ahead in [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOxsioL8=/).

[the Executive Summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DCLycveSFfl6AOltwq4rEAOVeuZWfRmVznJsK3LdWrM/edit?usp=sharing)
 - TLDR: Our plan is to embed with a dev team, help them by building out declarative infrastructure for testing
  while also understanding in more detail the pains that exist and are inhibiting platform adoption
 
 ## Post-Discovery Sprint
  - We're getting our accounts set up and access to the environment
  - User story mapping session planned for 25-26 Aug
  
  ## Current Blockers
As of today, we haven't found a dev team to embed with. Ideal team matches would be good personality fits as well as
good tech fits (have some infrastructures they need to test against that can be built declaratively in the cloud). Our mission hero
is working with the internal teams to find us a good fit but is focused on many priorities and our lack of clearances/access has led to 
some hesitation. 

### Potential Options
1. Utilize the User Story Mapping Session to meet some more people and expand our reach beyond just our mission hero to drive conversations ourselves.
This will hopefully lead to a "wider net" and help connect us. Plus at the time of the event, we should have our accounts so that will help.

Pros:
- Allows us to find a great fit with early adopters via interviews
- Will have the opportunity to show that the Platform team(s) is here to help!
- Will get unfiltered opinions on why workarounds have been utilized

Cons: 
- Potential further delays for starting work and adding mission value
2. Utilize our relationship with GITI to embed with one of their dev teams. 

Pros: 
- Connection would be fast because Scott has already offered to make introdcutions
- The team he has in mind is building out their own infrastructure (which doesn't "move" well) and maintain the product through OS updates to target system
- Likely also has some workarounds

Cons:
- May not be the best fit from a human to human perspective (it may be a great fit, we just won't know until we meet them)
- This is a different approach than what we agreed to with the mission hero
3. Request to integrate with other platform teams instead of embedding with a dev team

Pros: 
- We definitely have the skills to help here
- Might be more aligned with mission heroes initial expectations

Cons:
- They have recently re-org'd (twice!) and are forming as teams -- we may get lost
- The platform has current adoption issues that we don't think are fully flushed out, so we won't get as good of user (dev) feedback

#### Plan Moving Forward
Go down option 1 for the remainder of this week. If the conversations in person don't seem to lead in a direction that will result in 
introductions to dev teams, let's engage option 2 starting next week. I believe there is additional context to be gathered around why 
option 2 wasn't suggested initially. Option 3 is really our worst case scenario option because it doesn't provide as good of an avenue
for dev feedback/dev experience understanding which is our primary goal.
